The Iranian regime continues to carry out an ongoing massacre against its own people, killing protesters, political dissidents, women, children, and ethnic minorities in a brutal campaign of repression. Canada has long stood as a champion of human rights and democratic values around the world. As Iranian-Canadians deeply committed to both our adopted country and the freedom of our homeland, we urgently need our Government to step up and take concrete action in support of the Iranian people.

We respectfully submit the following requests for your consideration and support:

A) Political, Security, and Foreign Policy Requests

1. Establishment of a Canada-led international alliance against the Islamic Republic of Iran
Given the Islamic Republic’s commission of crimes against humanity, there is an urgent obligation for collective international action to protect the Iranian population. We respectfully urge the Government of Canada to assume a leadership role in forming an international alliance to coordinate unified political, legal, economic, and protective measures against the regime.
We call on Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government to invite European Union member states and other like-minded countries to join this global initiative, grounded in the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) principle.
